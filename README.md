# Stardew Valley Mod - Better Ranching
Stardew Valley mod that adds an icon above animals when they are ready to be milked/sheared or petted and prevents failing milking/shearing attempts: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/859/

Compatible with Stardew Valley 1.3.31+ on Linux, Mac, and Windows. Requires SMAPI 2.8 or later.

**New Update:** Pathoschild updated the mod to work with Stardew Valley 1.3.31 and SMAPI 2.8-- if you have an earlier version of Stardew (1.3.28 or below), you may need to grab an earlier version of the mod!
